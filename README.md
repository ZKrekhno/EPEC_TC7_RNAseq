This repo contains the code for **"Dual RNA-sequencing reveals pathogen and host transcriptomic changes during enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection"** paper by *Zakhar Krekhno, Antonio Serapio-Palacios, and Brett Finlay*.  
The code for raw sequence analysis is available in the main repo and split by experimental conditions (non-polarized and polarized TC-7 infections).  
The analysis of the reads from the infection of non-polarized TC-7 cells can be found in the `short_infection...` folders, with separate folders for EPEC and human reads.  
The analysis of the reads from the infection of polarized TC-7 cells can be founs in the `long_infection...` folders, with separate folders for EPEC and human reads. Human reads folders contain the mRNA and miRNA analyses.
